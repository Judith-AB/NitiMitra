### Problem Statement
For millions of young Indians (18â€“30), navigating government schemes, taxes, and financial policies is overwhelming. Complex jargon, scattered information, and lack of awareness lead to missed benefits, poor financial planning, and low trust in official processes. Tier-2 and Tier-3 city youth are especially excluded due to language barriers, digital inaccessibility, and lack of personalized guidance. This creates a critical gap where policies designed to empower youth remain underutilized.
